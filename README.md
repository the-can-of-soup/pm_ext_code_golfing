(even though i had the idea first they were just the first one to say it)

## Rules
- You are trying to code a working extension with the lowest file size possible (measured in bytes).
- To be a valid entry, the extension must be loadable in PenguinMod/TurboWarp (depending on category) via the File import tab.
- To submit, comment the categor(y/ies) and code in this space and **make sure to ping me `@the_can_of_soup`.**
- Edited messages are disqualified.
- Unless otherwise specified:
  - Errors do not disqualify submissions, as long as the requirements are still met.
  - No other extensions may be loaded before or after loading the submission when testing.
  - Loading a pre-existing extension is not allowed.
